# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project has been refactored to use MPID data instead of UUID data. The UI has been updated, and the project has been rebranded.

## Next Steps

The project is ready for deployment.

## Decisions

*   The application now uses a simple search and filter mechanism for MPIDs.
*   The complex scrolling and animation logic from the original project has been removed.
*   The UI has been simplified to a single table view.
