# Product Context

This application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing and filtering MPIDs. Users, likely financial professionals, need a quick way to look up and manage these identifiers. The original project's "starring" or "favoriting" functionality will be retained to allow users to track specific MPIDs.

## Problem Solved

Financial professionals often need to reference MPIDs from the NSCC directory. This tool will provide a more accessible and interactive way to work with this data than a raw spreadsheet.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Clarity:** The data should be presented in a clean, easy-to-read table.
*   **Efficiency:** Users should be able to quickly find and filter the MPIDs they are interested in.
*   **Persistence:** Favorited MPIDs should be saved for future sessions.
